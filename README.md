# Health in the United States

This project investigated the current overall health of adults in the US. I explored data from the 2021 Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey which randomly selected adults residing in the US and stratified by location. Then, I created a Bernoulli regression model to investigate the potential factors related to whether or not an individual has one or more chronic health conditions. The published Quarto website with all the analysis is [here](https://annashao12.quarto.pub/health-in-the-us/).
