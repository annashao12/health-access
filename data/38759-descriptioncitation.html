		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> In December 2017, the Urban Institute launched the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey (WBNS), a nationally representative, internet-based survey of non-elderly adults designed to monitor changes in individual and family well-being during a time when policymakers are considering significant changes to federal safety net programs serving low-income families. The 2021 round of the survey collects information on a broad array of topics related to health, material hardship, and the safety net, including health insurance, housing, food security, employment, family income, program participation, family financial security, disability, effects of COVID-19 on school attendance, experiences of discrimination, the child tax credit, and immigration issues.</span></p>

		        		<h2>Methodology:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Study Purpose:</strong> The Urban Institute launched the Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey (WBNS) to monitor changes in individual and family health and well-being as policymakers make changes to federal safety net programs and the labor market continues to evolve.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Sample:</strong> For each round, a stratified random sample of approximately 7,500 adults ages 18 to 64 was drawn from the KnowledgePanel, a probability-based, nationally representative Internet panel maintained by Ipsos. The WBNS included an oversample of adults with household incomes under 150 percent of the federal poverty level (FPL) to improve the precision of estimates for this group. The 2021 round includes additional oversamples of Black adults with household incomes between 150-250 percent of FPL and Asian adults. Current recruitment into the KnowledgePanel is based on an address-based sampling frame that covers nearly all residential addresses in the United States. In earlier periods, recruitment was carried out by telephone based on random-digit dialing sampling techniques. Approximately 55,000 U.S. households participated in the panel, including those with and without internet access. Web-enabled devices and internet access were provided to panel members if needed, and respondents can complete the online surveys in English or Spanish.</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Time Method:</strong> Cross-sectional</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Universe:</strong> Household population aged 18-64</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Unit(s) of Observation:</strong> Individual</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Data Type(s):</strong> survey data</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Mode of Data Collection:</strong> web-based survey</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Response Rates:</strong> The WBNS response rate is roughly three to four percent each round.</span></p>
		        		<h2>Version(s):</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Original Release Date:</strong> 2023-12-12</span></p>
								<p><span><strong>Version History:</strong> <p>2023-12-12 ICPSR data undergo a confidentiality review and are altered when necessary to limit the risk of disclosure. ICPSR also routinely creates ready-to-go data files along with setups in the major statistical software formats as well as standard codebooks to accompany the data. In addition to these procedures, ICPSR performed the following processing steps for this data collection:</p><ul><li>Created online analysis version with question text.</li><li>Checked for undocumented or out-of-range codes.</li></ul></span></p>
		        		<h2>Analysis Information:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Weight:</strong> The WBNS weights reflect the probability of sample selection from the KnowledgePanel and post-stratification to the characteristics of nonelderly adults in the United States based on benchmarks from the Current Population Survey and American Community Survey for the following measures: age by gender; race and ethnicity; educational attainment; presence of children in the household; census region; residence in a metropolitan area; homeownership status; family income as a percentage of the federal poverty level; family composition (married or living with a partner by presence of children in the family); primary language; and internet access by age.</span></p>
