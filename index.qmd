A person's health outcome and the extent of healthcare received depend on factors such as their identity and living situation. The data used in this project was pulled from the 2021 Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey conducted by the Urban Institute. I determined individuals' health based on whether they were living with any health conditions that lasted longer than a year. Then, I used a Bernoulli regression model to understand individuals' health condition—a binary Yes/No variable—based on factors such as their age and marital status. People with one to three children are significantly less likely to have a health condition. The probability of having a health condition for people without children is 56 ± 2.5%, whereas for people with three children, it is 47 ± 5.2%.
