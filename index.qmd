Within the diversity of individuals residing in the US, there remain discrepancies in people's health and the healthcare they are able to receive. The data used in this project was pulled from the 2021 Well-Being and Basic Needs Survey conducted by the Urban Institute of adults in the US. I analyzed individuals' health based on whether they were living with any health conditions that lasted longer than one year. I used a Bernoulli regression model to understand individuals' health condition, a binary Yes/No variable, based on factors such as their age and marital status. People with one to three children are significantly less likely to have a health condition. The probability of having a health condition for people without children is 56.2% (+/- 2.5%) whereas for people with three children is 47.3% (+/- 5.2%).
