## Formula for the Model

I used a Bernoulli model with two outcomes: [Yes]{.underline} and [No]{.underline}, for whether the individual has one or more health conditions.

$$health\_condition_{i} \sim Bernoulli(\rho = 0.56)$$

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
health\_condition_{i} = 
      & \beta_{0} \\
    + & \beta_{1} age_i \\
    + & \beta_{2} sex_i \\
    + & \beta_{3} marital\_status_i \\
    + & \beta_{4} limited\_access_{i} \\
    + & \beta_{5} num\_of\_children_{i} \\
    + & \epsilon_{i} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```
## Table of Coefficients

The intercept ($\beta_{0}$) is for calculating $\rho$ using the average aged adult female who has never married, does not have limited access to healthcare, and has zero children.

```{r fig.align = "center"}
#| label: table
#| warning: false

```

Some results were expected. As age increases, the probability of having a health condition is higher. Similarly, individuals who have had difficulty accessing healthcare are more likely to also be the ones who have a chronic health condition. This relationship could potentially be mutually reinforcing.

Furthermore, divorced individuals were more likely to have a health condition. It could be that their health condition resulted in the divorce or the divorce caused onset of a health condition or an entirely different confounding variable.

Interestingly, males, married individuals, and individuals with one to three children were less likely to have a health condition.

## Posterior Predictive Check

Each bar represented one of the two potential outcomes for health_condition. The ten replicates had little variation between them and precisely captured the actual data.

#| label: ppcheck
