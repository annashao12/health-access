## Formula for the Regression Model

I used a Bernoulli model in which there are two outcomes: **Yes** and **No**, for whether the individual has one or more health conditions.

$$health\_condition_{i} \sim Bernoulli(\rho = 0.56)$$

```{=tex}
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
health\_condition_{i} = 
      & \beta_{0} \\
    + & \beta_{1} age_i \\
    + & \beta_{2} sex_i \\
    + & \beta_{3} marital\_status_i \\
    + & \beta_{4} limited\_access_{i} \\
    + & \beta_{5} num\_of\_children_{i} \\
    + & \epsilon_{i} \\
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
```

## Table of Coefficients

The intercept ($\beta_{0}$) is for calculating $\rho$ using the average aged adult female who has never married, does not have limited access to healthcare, and has zero children.
